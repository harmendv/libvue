        We don't offer any grid system because we believe there are only two main use-cases: layout & content. Layout is
        most of the time a one-time-job and creating a grid system for content that satisfies all needs is impossible.
        To help you out for the most simple use-cases we've made two simple components for layout and grouping content.
        The rest is up to your CSS skills.
